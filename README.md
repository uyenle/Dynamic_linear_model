# Master Thesis: MACROECONOMIC FORECAST USING GOOGLE SEARCH DATA
FOR VIETNAM BY DYNAMIC LINEAR MODELS

This thesis aims to investigate the nowcasting gains obtained from the real-time Google Search data comparing to the models implemented only the conventional macroeconomic indicators. At the same time, the empirical result in this thesis support the benefits of DMA and DMS in nowcasting improvement for an emerging economy like Vietnam.

*Model
Often in macroeconomic forecast, many candidate explanatory variables are available thus the number of possible models is large. Therefore, Dynamic Model Averaging (DMA) and Dynamic Model Selecting (DMS), are implemented in this paper to deal with this situation. DMA and DMS have been proven to be a valuable approach to manage the environment of coefficient instability and over-parameterization which often arise in forecast large models for economic variables.
DMA and DMS are constructed on the ground of TVP and BMA models that allow the change among a set of TVP models. Each TVP models include an individual combination of predictors in the models, DMA is weighted-averaged of the set of TVP models while DMS is the best selection among the set.

*Data
Google data potentially provide predicting power since the frequency of some certain queries are be highly correlated with the ongoing economic activity at a time point, they perform well whether in developed or developing countries.
